# Time-series-analysis

1) First I import all the libraries that i need.
2) I transferred the data to an excel so that it becomes more easy recording of the file from the program.
3) I use the data.info() command to see if I have online prices in the data .
4) I use the command data.head() to see the first rows in the data table.
5) I defined an array with city name which contains all the names of cities and using the singular define each name as a unique city.
6)I plot the cumulative cases of each
city. On the x axis I have the days and on the y the cases.
